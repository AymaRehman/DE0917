Validating flight records against specified rules.
Separating valid and invalid records.
Exporting valid flights to a JSON database (db.json).
Logging invalid rows with explanations (errors.txt).
Optionally loading an existing JSON database.
Executing queries from a JSON file and generating a query response JSON.

### Features Implemented

|4|Read and print CSV content|✅|
|5|Basic field splitting, minimal validation|✅|
|6|Full validation rules, separate valid/invalid, output files|✅|
|7|JSON output for valid flights|✅|
|8|CLI arguments -i, -d, -o|✅|
|9|Folder parsing, combined output, error handling|✅|
|10|Load JSON -j, query execution -q, datetime filtering, response JSON|✅|
